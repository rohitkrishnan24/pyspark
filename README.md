# IPL Data Analysis with PySpark ETL on Databricks and S3

Data Extraction:

Loaded the IPL dataset into an Amazon S3 bucket for secure and scalable storage.

Data Transformation:

Used PySpark within the Databricks platform to process and transform the data.
Performed data cleaning, filtering, and aggregation.
Derived meaningful insights through PySpark and SQL operations.

Data Loading:

Stored the transformed data back in S3 or made it available within Databricks for further analysis.
This ETL process facilitated efficient handling of large datasets, enabling the extraction of valuable insights into IPL performance metrics.

## Tech Stack

**Amazon S3:**

Served as the storage platform for the IPL dataset, providing secure, scalable, and cost-effective storage. S3â€™s integration with Databricks enabled seamless access and retrieval of the data for processing.

**Databricks:**

Functioned as the primary platform for data processing and analysis. It provided an environment to run Apache Spark jobs and facilitated collaboration, scalability, and efficient handling of large datasets.

**PySpark:**

Usage: Used for data transformation tasks within the Databricks environment. PySpark enabled distributed processing of large datasets, allowing for efficient data cleaning, filtering, aggregation, and the creation of derived insights.

**SQL (Structured Query Language):**

Usage: Employed for querying and managing the transformed data within Databricks. SQL was used to perform complex data operations and to extract insights from the processed data.

**Apache Spark:**

Usage: The underlying data processing engine used by PySpark. Apache Spark provided the distributed computing capabilities necessary for processing large volumes of data quickly and efficiently.**
